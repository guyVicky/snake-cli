**DO NOT PLAY !!!** - An overcomplicated and unoptimised implementation of snake game that serves no other purpose than my amusement

  ![snake in a room](https://github.com/guyVicky/snake-cli/blob/master/assets/main_screen.png)


## How to play
- Be a linux user (!!)
- Download the linux app from bin/ directory
- execute it in a terminal emulator
- Ensure your terminal dimensions is atleast 50x25 and font-size over 14 for the best experience (although the game works with any size of terminal emulator)

## Snake Rules/Controls

Control your snake around with `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys and grow in length by eating the fruits that spawn randomly in the level. Keep holding the key to traverse large distance quickly.<br><br>

You die if you hit either of the walls/obstacles or yourself. Achieve a score of 100 to win.
